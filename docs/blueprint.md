## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) - A vibrant blue (#3399FF) to represent clarity and focus.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) provides a comfortable backdrop, avoiding stark white.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) - A contrasting teal (#33CCCC) highlights interactive elements and important actions.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font to provide a modern techy look
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font well-suited for comfortable readability of long writeups.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for common formatting actions (e.g., bold, italics, headings). These should be visually consistent and easily recognizable.
- A clean, distraction-free layout with a clear separation between the text editor and formatting controls. Maximize screen space for the writing area.
- Subtle transitions for UI elements, such as formatting menus sliding in and out, or highlighting the active formatting option.  Keep animations short and non-distracting.
